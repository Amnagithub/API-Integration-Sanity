# BUILDING DYNAMIC FRONTEND COMPONENTS

Today's foucus on my project's frontend, built with a combination of static and dynamic components. Static components are pre-rendered and served from a CDN, while dynamic components are rendered on the server or client-side. This approach allows us for fast page loads and reusable component design and real-world practices for building scalable and responsive web applications.
